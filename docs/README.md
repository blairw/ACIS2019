### Is this the official ACIS 2019 conference website?

Unfortunately, as at time of writing (17 July 2020), the official conference website (acis2019.org) seems to be a bit unwell. While we await its expedient recovery, we can take advantage of the fact that all ACIS 2019 papers are _"distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Australia License, which permits non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and ACIS are credited"_.

All papers presented at ACIS 2019 are available for download below (scroll to **"Papers by Track"**). All credits for the papers go to the original authors (listed below) and ACIS.

This website is not affiliated with ACIS, AAIS, or Curtin University. It is a voluntary project to make the ACIS 2019 proceedings available online (by which I mean, I copied the PDFs from the handy little ACIS 2019 USB that they gave out at the conference and indexed them below after some CSV-wrangling with [csvtomd](https://github.com/mplewis/csvtomd)). For further details, please contact [Blair Wang](https://www.blair.wang).

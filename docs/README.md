## ACIS 2019 online proceedings

### What is this?

The Australiasian Conference on Information Systems (ACIS) was held in Perth (Australia) on 9-11 December, 2019. Unfortunately, the official website (acis2019.org) seems to be a bit unwell at the moment. While we await its expedient recovery, we can take advantage of the fact that all ACIS 2019 papers are licensed under CC-BY-NC:
